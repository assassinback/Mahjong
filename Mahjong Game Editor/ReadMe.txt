 Add additional sorting layers to your project:

"Tile1"
"Tile2"
"Tile3"
"Tile4"
"Tile5"
"Knock"

Right Upper corner of the Unity Editor you find Layers Button. Press it and select Edit Layers. Then add layers in the same order as presented above.

---------------Editor Window-----------------
Open Demo scene and press play. In-Game Panel you should see that the editor appears with the last template created. 
There are 3 templates created by me (Assets/Mahjong Template Editor/Templates - the path where all templates will be saved and from where they will load).

1. Editor Left Panel

Buttons:
a) New Template Button - Creates a new template. 
Note: a new template will not be saved at least there are 2 dots activated. 

b) Find Field and Find Button - Enter a template number and press Find Button. The required template should be loaded.

c) Find First Button - Loads first template;

d) Find Last Button - Loads last template;

e) Save Button - Saves current template;

f) Load Button - Loads current template last time it was saved;

2. Editor Right Panel
Editor Right Panel shows information about the template:
Name of the template;
Amount of tiles;
Number of combinations;

Clear button - Clear field from active dots. 
Note: A cleared template will not be saved at least there are 2 dots activated. If you want to delete the template go to Assets/Mahjong Template Editor/Templates and delete the template file.

---------------Game Window-----------------
After you saved the template you can test it. 
With the loaded template press the To The Game Button (Right lower corner of the screen) and press Start on Game Panel - the template should be loaded as a group of mahjong tiles;
